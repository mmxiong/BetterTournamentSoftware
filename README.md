This is an attempt to become the Mark Zuck of tournament running. Instead of toppling MySpace, a billion dollar
social network, we're going to topple TournamentSoftware, an arguably smaller predecessor. Plus we're probably not
going to make a billion dollars by the time we're 20, and who knows if it'll even work. Nonetheless, it's worth a try.

Plus it might be fun, but that's obviously auxiliary to becoming teenage millionaires.

The idea is this:
As badminton players, we play tournaments, where hundreds of players converge on a single gym with limited court space
(anywhere from 6 to 20+ courts), and play out a tournament. The problem arises when we host multiple events like men's
singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles, as a single man may play in all three brackets. This causes a lot of
headache when trying to schedule matches, since there are a lot of limitations. These limitations result in a slow
down of match calling, leading to extremely long tournaments (try being in a confined space with 500 sweaty athletes
from 8am to midnight, and tell me that's not a problem).

For example:
Two matches of different events (men's singles/doubles) but containing the same player cannot be played simultaneously
A match cannot closely follow a previous match if they share a player
    (that player needs to rest, since physical activity sucks)
A match cannot be called if a player is on lunch breaks (which they often tend to do at great length, the bane of TD's)
A match cannot be called if it depends on the result of a previous match (duh)

A mix of these rules makes it very difficult sometimes to determine which is the next valid match to cal

So the plan is to create a tool that will allow us to input the brackets of the various events, and have our tool spit
out events for the TD (tournament director) to execute. For example, when it comes time for a match to be called, we
will output something like "Yo TDawg, call match 3", or "Yo TDawg, cal match 3 again, and remind them they have 5
minutes to default". The idea is that we take the thinking that usually the TD does, and do it for him. That way there's
no brain crunching on what matches can or can't be played. This way, we can maintain high court usage (the main culprit
behind slow tournaments)
